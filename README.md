# YouTube-Audio-Converter
Don't use that sketchy website to download YT video audio anymore! Use python instead!


I like to make short animations, and so I often download YouTube videos for their audio. However, my current method of downloading videos is quite long. First I download the video using RealDownloader(I've been using it for nearly 10 years, and since I'm using the free version, it's gotten very slow). Then I convert the video into MP3 or WAV form. I have been learning how powerful Python can be, and looked up something to download things using Python.

Using my previous project(Art Prompt Generator) as a framework, and this code from Geeks for Geeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/download-video-in-mp3-format-using-pytube/), I was able to make a small program to download videos without using a sketchy site or my quite slow process described above.

There are two versions of this code. The first downloads in MP3 only. The second, which should be included shortly, allows for MP3 and WAV form audio. I hope you enjoy!
