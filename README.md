# YouTube-Audio-Converter
Don't use that sketchy website to download YT video audio anymore! Use Python instead!


I like to make short animations, and so I often download YouTube videos for their audio. However, my current method of downloading videos is quite long. First I download the video using RealDownloader (I've been using it for nearly 10 years, and since I'm using the free version, it's gotten very slow). Then I convert the video into MP3 or WAV format. I have been learning how powerful Python can be, and looked up something to download things using Python.

Using my previous project (Art Prompt Generator) as a framework, and this code from Geeks for Geeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/download-video-in-mp3-format-using-pytube/), I was able to make a small program to download videos without using a sketchy site or my quite slow process described above. It allows you to download a YouTube video's audio in MP3 or WAV format.

V4 is the best version of the program included in this repository, with V1 only allowing MP3 downloads and V2 and V3 having some unresolved problems (uploaded to keep track of my progress and as a method of version control). I hope you enjoy!

Note that you should have PyTube and PySimpleGUI installed on your machine for this program to work.
